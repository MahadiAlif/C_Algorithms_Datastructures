- **Labs**: Contains lab assignments from coursework, covering specific programming concepts and algorithms.
- **Projects**: Personal projects that showcase creative and practical implementations of algorithms.
- **Exercises**: Practice problems and small implementations to solidify concepts.

## Highlights

Some key projects and their descriptions:

1. **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of various sorting techniques (quick sort, merge sort, heap sort, etc.) with performance analysis.
2. **Pathfinding Algorithm**: A practical implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph.
3. **String Manipulator**: A project focusing on string operations such as parsing, searching, and transformation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/C-and-Algorithms-Repo.git
